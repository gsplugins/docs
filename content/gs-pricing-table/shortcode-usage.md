**Usage** – Copy and use shortcode into your Post, Page or Custom Post editor to display Pricing Table.

```
[gs_pt id="256"]
```

256 is Table ID, so Shortcode will be [gs_pt id="Table_ID"]

**Shortcodes are auto generated, just copy & paste at your desired place!**

Shortcode PHP Usage

```
<?php echo do_shortcode( '[gs_pt id="256"]' ); ?>
```

Template Usage – Copy and paste the code where you need to display the Pricing Table in template files (header.php, front-page.php, etc.)

**Shortcodes are auto generated, just copy & paste at your desired place!**
