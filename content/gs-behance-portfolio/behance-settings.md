Behance Settings instructions added with each field.

NOTE : Behance API has been deprecated &amp; not allowed to register new apps to get Behance Access Token. We have rewritten the plugin &amp; GOOD NEWS is that no <em>Behance Access Token</em> needed! Means without Behance API key you can display projects to your site. So, <strong><del>Behance Access Token</del></strong> field deleted at version <strong>2.0.8</strong>
