## Create your project

 Hugo provides a `new` command to create a new website   
 
```shell script
hugo new site theme_name
```

## Theme Setup

After creating new site, open this folder and you will find a folder called `themes`. Open this folder and place your downloaded themes here (extracted folder). now open it and you will see a folder called `exampleSite`  

In this folder you need to copy/cut every folder and file, then go back to your root folder that you create with `theme_name` . and paste everything here, it will asked you for replacement file and folder, click on replace, and it will replace with the necessary file. You are all set.

## Launching the website locally

Now you can run this theme in your localhost by this `hugo server` command in the root folder directory. and you can see this on [localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313/)
