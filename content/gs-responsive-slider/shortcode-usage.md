**Usage** – Copy and use shortcode into your Post, Page or Custom Post editor to display GS Responsive Slider.

```
[gs_rsl id="176"]
```

176 is Slider ID, so Shortcode will be <code>[gs_rsl id="Slider_ID"]</code>

**Shortcodes are auto generated, just copy &amp; paste at your desired place!**

##### Shortcode PHP Usage

```
<?php echo do_shortcode( '[gs_rsl id="176"]' ); ?>
```

Template Usage – Copy and paste the code where you need to display the GS Responsive Slider in template files (header.php, front-page.php, etc.)

**Shortcodes are auto generated, just copy &amp; paste at your desired place!**
