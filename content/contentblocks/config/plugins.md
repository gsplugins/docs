You can add third party plugins from here very easily, We create a loop for plugins, you will see two plugins loop here, first one is for css and last one is for js. just copy a loop item that you need and paste it in the bottom of the loop. and link correctly, after added a plugins, you maybe need to close the hugo server and run it again for rendered correctly.
